Hey! First of all, thanks for contributing or thinking or contributing to Ruse!

Ruse's contributing process is pretty lightweight. If you have a question or idea about Ruse,
open an issue. If you want to contribute, open a pull request. Pull requests are squashed into
one commit before merging, to keep the history reasonably easy to follow. We're happy to work
with you to get your pull request into the state it needs to be. For now, we only care that
you've:

- Run [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) over your changes
- Run [Clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) over your changes

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
